My name is Rodney. I am a keen developer in building accessible site in Gatsby.  I am equally keen to hear your suggestions for improving this project.  Thanks for your interest in the project.  Could I ask you to take a look at the project's Code of Conduct before continuing with your contribution? Thanks!  A good starting point for getting up-to-speed on the project os the REAFME file.
